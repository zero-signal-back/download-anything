# TeraBox Download Notes

TeraBox is highly protected and difficult to download from programmatically.

## Why TeraBox is Hard:
1. Requires login for most files
2. Uses dynamic JavaScript rendering
3. Has anti-bot protection
4. Links expire quickly
5. Rate limiting

## Current Status:
- Basic support added with Selenium
- Works for some public links
- May fail for password-protected or login-required links

## Recommendation:
For reliable TeraBox downloads, use:
- Browser extensions
- Paid API services
- Manual download through browser

## Alternative Platforms:
All other 17+ platforms work perfectly:
- YouTube, Instagram, Facebook, Twitter
- Google Drive, Mega, MediaFire, GoFile
- Direct links, M3U8 streams, etc.
